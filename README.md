# Object Detection using YOLOv8n

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the **YOLOv8n** model (from Ultralytics).  
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, fast, and accurate object detection algorithm.

# ðŸ“¦ Features
- Object detection on **images**, **videos**, and **webcam streams**
- Built on the lightweight YOLOv8n variant for faster inference
- Simple and modular Python code

# ðŸš€ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tamilkumaran78/Object_detection.git
   cd Object_detection
   The script will ask you to choose:
        >Image file
        >Video file
        >Webcam
  # âœ… Requirements:
         >Python 3.8+
         >Ultralytics YOLO
         >OpenCV
